# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Start every session here

Read these three first — they carry state across compaction and fresh conversations:
1. **`HANDOFF.md`** — current state, decisions, live URLs, security findings, gotchas. The fastest way to get up to speed.
2. **`TODO.md`** — engineering backlog, ordered. Pick the next item from here.
3. **`MANUAL_TODOS.md`** — human-only steps (API keys, dashboard config); check before assuming something can be automated.

`docs/PLAN.md` has the full phased plan; `DESIGN.md` / `PRODUCT.md` are required reading before UI work.

## Keep the live status dashboard current (REQUIRED)

There is a published Claude Artifact tracking build status — running subagents, PRs in review, shipped/deployed work, the queue, and the 7 goal items:
**https://claude.ai/code/artifact/98a0341f-6f7b-4043-8a5e-5b4ff86ea715** (title `matchpoint · build status`).

Keep it live and accurate. Whenever session state changes materially — a subagent starts/finishes, a PR opens/merges/deploys, a task moves between queued/in-review/done — refresh the artifact **in the same turn**, before ending. Update it by republishing to that exact URL: pass `url: "https://claude.ai/code/artifact/98a0341f-6f7b-4043-8a5e-5b4ff86ea715"` to the Artifact tool (find it via `action: "list"` if the URL is lost). Preserve the Split Heart design system, keep the `❤️` favicon and the stable title so it stays the same artifact. Data comes from `TODO.md` + `gh pr list`.

## Use the knowledge graph for file context

This repo has a graphify knowledge graph at `graphify-out/` (code structure, god nodes, communities, cross-file edges). Prefer it over blind grep/full-file reads for "where/what/how" questions — it returns a scoped subgraph, far smaller than reading files.

- Codebase questions: `graphify query "<question>"` (when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists). `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for how two things connect; `graphify explain "<concept>"` for a focused node.
- Broad orientation: skim `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` (god nodes = the load-bearing shared code, e.g. `useTheme`, `useSession`, `Text`, `Button`).
- After changing code, refresh it: `graphify . --update` (AST-only, no LLM/API key, cheap). The graph currently covers code (AST); docs/images can be folded in with a full `graphify .` run when subagents/Gemini are available.

## Working style (keep context lean)

- **Delegate token-heavy work to subagents.** Send research and self-contained implementation to subagents with strict file ownership; they do the heavy reading and report a concise summary, keeping the main thread's context clean. The main thread orchestrates, verifies, and commits — **subagents never commit or push.**
- **Work in small chunks.** One logical feature per unit of work. Finish, commit, deploy, then move on — don't let a session balloon until it needs compaction.
- **Update the handoff before context fills.** When a session has made meaningful progress, refresh `HANDOFF.md` and `TODO.md` so the next session (or a fresh conversation) resumes instantly.

## Branch → review → test → PR protocol (REQUIRED for all code changes)

Never commit code straight to `main`. For every piece of new work:

1. **Feature branch per task.** Create `feat/<task-slug>` (or `fix/<slug>`) off `main` before writing code — one branch per task/feature.
2. **caveman-commit every commit.** Use `/caveman-commit` to generate each commit message (Conventional Commits, terse).
3. **Code-review every commit.** Run `/caveman-review` on the diff before it lands; address findings.
4. **Test every change (REQUIRED).** Add/update tests for the change and keep the suite green at **≥90% coverage** on the logic scope. Verify before claiming done: `npm test` (jest), `deno test supabase/functions/` (if the edge function changed), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npx expo export --platform web`, the hex grep, and — when observable — drive it in the browser / probe the live backend. Migrations that add selected columns must be run before a bundle that selects them ships. Logic worth testing lives in `lib/` (pure, unit-tested) and `supabase/functions/*/logic.ts`; extract testable logic out of components/providers rather than mocking heavily. The husky `pre-push` hook blocks any push whose typecheck/lint/tests fail; CI (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) re-runs `test` + `deno-test` and deploy is gated on them.
5. **PR, don't push to main.** When the branch is ready, open a PR to `main` with `gh pr create` and STOP — the human reviews and merges manually. Do not merge or push to `main` yourself. Deploy happens on their merge.

`main` is protected-by-convention: it only changes through a human-reviewed PR.

## What this is

Tinder-style swipe app for pairs (couples/friends). Two people share a room via 6-char invite code, swipe decks per category (food, restaurants, vacations, activities, date_nights, shows), and only mutual likes surface as matches. Anonymous-first: no accounts (Supabase anonymous auth); auth upgrade is a planned MVP2 feature.

One Expo codebase ships iOS, Android, and web. Web deploys to GitHub Pages (live at https://rchhatwal3.github.io/matchpoint/, redirects to ramneekchhatwal.com/matchpoint).

## Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Dev server (all platforms): `npm start` — web at localhost:8081
- Web only: `npm run web`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit; covers whole tree)
- Lint: `npm run lint` (expo lint; covers app/ + components/ only)
- Web build: `npm run build:web` (`expo export --platform web` → `dist/`)
- Test: `npm test` (jest-expo, app logic) · `npm run test:ci` (with 90% coverage gate) · `deno test supabase/functions/` (edge function). Verification = tests + typecheck + lint + web export + manual browser flow.

## Architecture

### Data flow (the part that needs multiple files to understand)

`providers/SessionProvider.tsx` is the hub. It owns: anonymous session bootstrap, room/member/partner state, all Supabase reads/writes, realtime subscriptions, and match detection. Screens consume it via `useSession()` and never call Supabase directly.

**Match detection is dual-path, deduped by a `seenMatchIds` ref:**
1. On my like, `recordSwipe` queries the partner's swipe row — if they already liked, match fires immediately (works fully async, partners never need to be online together).
2. A realtime `postgres_changes` subscription on the partner's swipes (event `*`, not INSERT — a pass→like change arrives as UPDATE via upsert) catches the partner liking later.

Either path sets `pendingMatch`, rendered once by the root-level `MatchOverlay` mounted in `app/_layout.tsx`.

**Offline demo mode:** when `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are absent, `lib/supabase.ts` exports `supabase = null` and SessionProvider swaps to bundled `data/seed.json` + in-memory swipes (solo, no matches). Every data method has this branch — preserve it when adding features.

### Backend (supabase/)

Migrations are ordered and all must be applied (SQL editor or `supabase db push`): schema → RLS → RPCs → grants → realtime publication. Three non-obvious constraints learned the hard way:

- New Supabase projects grant nothing to `authenticated` on public tables — RLS alone is not enough; see `004_grants.sql`.
- The `supabase_realtime` publication ships empty — tables must be added or `postgres_changes` silently never fires; see `005_realtime.sql`.
- RLS policies that subquery `members` recurse; the `member_room_id()` SECURITY DEFINER helper exists to break that loop. Every SECURITY DEFINER function must set `search_path`.

Room membership: `members.id` = `auth.uid()` (one user, one room). `create_room`/`join_room` are SECURITY DEFINER RPCs; `join_room` is idempotent. `room_matches` view uses `security_invoker = true` so RLS applies to callers.

### Theme system

`lib/theme/tokens.ts` is the only file allowed to contain hex colors — CI-adjacent check is `grep -rEn "#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}" app components providers --include="*.tsx"` → must be zero hits. Screens resolve colors via `useTheme()`; light/dark both come from tokens. `ThemeProvider` adds a persisted user override (system/light/dark) cycled by the `ThemeToggle` overlay in `_layout.tsx`. Gate all animation on `useReducedMotion()`.

DESIGN.md is binding, not advisory. Its four named rules (Two-Color, No-Beige, Muted-Floor, Calm-Surface) are hard stops enforced in review.

### Deploy

Push to `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (typecheck + lint gate, `expo export --platform web`, publish `dist/` to `gh-pages`). Supabase keys are baked in at build time from repo Actions secrets; missing secrets degrade to offline demo mode, not a broken build. `app.json` `experiments.baseUrl: "/matchpoint"` is required for the project-pages path — don't remove it.

## Project docs

- `docs/PLAN.md` — phased implementation plan + MVP2 roadmap (auth: email/Google/Apple)
- `docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md` — backend setup steps in order
- `MANUAL_TODOS.md` — human-only steps (API keys, store accounts, secrets); check here before assuming something can be automated
- `PRODUCT.md` / `DESIGN.md` — impeccable-skill context; read both before UI work

## Conventions

- Branches: `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>` kebab-case. Repo: rchhatwal3/matchpoint.
- No web-only libraries (framer-motion, react-router-dom) — expo-router + react-native-reanimated everywhere.
- Never put the Supabase `service_role` key anywhere in this repo; edge functions read it from their runtime env.
- Frontend never calls third-party APIs at runtime — external data goes through Supabase Edge Functions (`supabase/functions/`).
