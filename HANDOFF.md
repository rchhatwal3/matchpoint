# HANDOFF — matchpoint

Read this first when resuming. Snapshot of state, decisions, and what's next. Last updated 2026-07-22.

## What it is
Tinder-style swipe app for pairs (couples/friends). Two people share a room via 6-char invite code (Supabase anonymous auth — no accounts yet), swipe decks per category, and only mutual likes become matches. One Expo codebase → iOS + Android + web; web is the live deploy target.

## Live
- **Deployed:** https://rchhatwal3.github.io/matchpoint/ (301-redirects to ramneekchhatwal.com/matchpoint — user chose to keep the redirect).
- Deploy = push to `main` → GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) typecheck+lint+`expo export --platform web` → `gh-pages`. Supabase keys come from repo Actions secrets.
- **Supabase project ref:** `kchrpzeqcionxspctbbl`. Migrations 001–009 all run. Anonymous sign-in enabled. Edge function `get-restaurants` deployed with `PLACES_API_KEY` secret set.

## Stack
Expo (expo-router, TS, react-native-reanimated + gesture-handler), Supabase (Postgres + RLS + anonymous auth + realtime + edge functions), Google Places API (New) via edge function. No web-only libs (no framer-motion/react-router-dom).

## Design — "Split Heart" (approved)
Crimson `#C2314F` = you/action/like; teal `#2E6B7A` = partner. From the favicon's two heart-halves. Fonts: Fraunces (serif, display moments) + Figtree (sans, all UI). Full system in `DESIGN.md`. Light + dark, user toggle. Dark ground is cool-neutral `#121317` (NOT orange/black — that was the rejected "Flame & Iris" iteration).

## Shipped features (all live)
Pairing + invite code; share invite link (`?code=` deep link); Reanimated swipe deck; realtime match reveal (dual-path detection); matches list; date-night randomizer (`/date-night`, category multiselect + "Surprise us"); locations settings + restaurants deck (Google photos + `$`–`$$$$` price filter); per-item emoji (tacos 🌮); light/dark/system theme toggle.

## Pending work (see TODO.md)
- **T9 login** — NOT built. Anonymous-to-permanent upgrade (email `updateUser`, Google/Apple `linkIdentity`) to preserve uid so rooms/matches survive. Build as a standalone `AuthProvider` + `/account` screen; do NOT rewrite `SessionProvider`. **Constraint from user:** an email-first account must NOT also be loginable via Google/Apple (no cross-provider override/merge) — don't offer linking on email accounts; verify Supabase doesn't auto-merge same-email identities.
- **T13 multi-room** — user belongs to many rooms, switch between them. Needs schema change (`members.id = auth.uid()` caps one room/user → many-to-many membership).
- **T15 travel photos** — real `image_url` for `vacations` items (Wikimedia Special:FilePath, verify 200s). Deferred: slow URL research kept exhausting subagent limits. SwipeCard already renders `image_url` when present, so this is data-only.
- **T16 security fixes** (audit done, fixes not applied — see below).

## Security audit (2026-07-22) — findings, fixes NOT yet applied
- PASS: RLS isolation (outsider sees 0 cross-room rows), RPCs injection-safe (no dynamic SQL), edge function JWT-gated (401 without), no secret leakage.
- **HIGH:** `get-restaurants` accepts arbitrary/unbounded `location` from any anon user, no per-user cap → Places API cost-abuse (financial DoS). Fix: cap `location` length (~80) AND restrict server-side to the caller's own `room.locations`.
- **MEDIUM:** anonymous sign-ups effectively uncapped (12 rapid → all 200). Fix: enable CAPTCHA + tighten rate limits in Supabase Auth settings.
- **LOW:** 11 moderate npm CVEs, all `@expo/config-plugins` build tooling (not runtime).

## Hard rules / gotchas (do not relearn the hard way)
- **DESIGN.md is binding:** Two-Color, No-Beige, Muted-Floor, Calm-Surface. Hex colors ONLY in `lib/theme/tokens.ts` — `grep -rEn "#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}" app components providers --include="*.tsx"` MUST be 0.
- **Migrations before deploy:** the app selects `emoji` and `price_level`; a missing column makes ALL online reads fail. Run new migrations in the SQL Editor before pushing a bundle that selects new columns.
- **New Supabase projects lack default grants:** `authenticated` needed `004_grants`, `service_role` (edge function) needed `007`. `supabase_realtime` publication ships empty (005 members/swipes, 006 rooms). RLS recursion avoided via `member_room_id()` SECURITY DEFINER helper; every definer fn sets `search_path`.
- **Never** put `service_role` in app code. **Frontend never calls third-party APIs** — external data goes through edge functions.
- **Orchestrator commits; subagents do NOT commit/push.** Use `/caveman-commit` for commit messages, `/caveman-review` for PR/diff review.

## Verify a change
`npm run typecheck` (tsc, whole tree) · `npm run lint` (app/ + components/) · `npx expo export --platform web` · hex grep (above) · live backend probe: source `.env`, python `urllib` against `/auth/v1/signup` → `/rest/v1/...` / `/functions/v1/get-restaurants`.

## Key files
`providers/SessionProvider.tsx` (session hub: anon auth, room/member/partner, all Supabase I/O, realtime, match detection), `lib/theme/tokens.ts` (only hex home), `components/SwipeCard.tsx` (image-or-emoji card), `supabase/functions/get-restaurants/index.ts` (Places + photo + price), `supabase/migrations/00{1..9}_*.sql`, `docs/PLAN.md` (phased plan), `MANUAL_TODOS.md` (human-only steps), `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`.
